# Warehouse-Route-planning

Warehouse Route Planning" optimizes goods movement, minimizing travel time and congestion. It includes mapping, route algorithms, WMS integration, real-time monitoring, and user-friendly interfaces.

# Greetings

## Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up and running the project.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3 (Download from [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- pip (usually comes bundled with Python)

### 2. Project Setup

1. Extract the downloaded project files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the extracted folder named "J&J_Project".

### 3. Install Dependencies

We'll use pip to install the required library: Flask.

In your terminal, run the following command:

pip install Flask

### 4. Run the Application

1. In the terminal, navigate back to the "J&J_Project" folder (if you've exited).
2. Run the following command to start the Flask app:

python app.py

### 5. Access the Warehouse Interface

1. Open a web browser.
2. Visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in the address bar. (Also direct via terminal just by Ctrl+click on the local host link)

This will display the warehouse layout with the shortest path highlighted.

### 6. Interact and Experiment!

Feel free to explore the warehouse layout displayed on the web page. The code resides in the `main.py` file. To experiment with different warehouse parameters and observe their impact on the shortest path calculation, modify this file as needed.
